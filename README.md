# LaMaEraser

## Overview
![LaMaEraser Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rootport-AI/LaMaEraser/main/demo.gif)
LaMaEraser is a web-based image editing tool that integrates with the [LaMa inpainting model](https://github.com/advimman/lama) to remove unwanted objects from images. Users can draw masks on the image using a brush, eraser, or bucket tool, and then process the image with AI to seamlessly erase the masked areas. This tool is built with Flask, JavaScript, and leverages Rootport-AI's GPU-enhanced fork of the LaMa model.

## Features
- Image Upload: Load images via file selection or drag-and-drop.  
- Drawing Tools: Brush, eraser, and bucket fill for mask creation.   
- AI Processing: Send masked images to LaMa for inpainting.
- Download: Save the processed image locally.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Windows OS (tested on Windows 10/11)
- Python 3.10
- Git
- Internet connection (for cloning repository and downloading models)
- CUDA GPU with VRAM 6GB or more.

### Steps
1. Download the Repository   
- Clone or download this repository from GitHub.  
2. Prepare the Files  
- Ensure the following files are in a single folder:  
```
app.py
index.html
main.js
nouislider.min.css
nouislider.min.js
require.txt
run.bat
setup.bat
style.css
\images
    defimg.png
    favicon16.png
    favicon32.png
    favicon64.png
    favicon_original.jpg
```
3. Run the Setup Script  
- Double-click setup.bat in the folder.  
- The script will:  
   - Create an \appfiles directory.  
   - Clone Rootport-AI's LaMa fork.
   - Copy necessary files to \appfiles\lama.
   - Set up a Python virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies from require.txt.
   - Download and extract the big-lama model from Hugging Face.
4. Verify Installation
- After setup completes, check \appfiles\lama for the installed files.  

## Usage
1. Launch the Application  
- Double-click run.bat to start the Flask server.
2. Access the Tool  
- Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:7859.  
3. Edit an Image  
- Load an image using the "Load" button (F) or drag-and-drop.  
- Use the brush (B), eraser (E), or bucket (G) to draw a mask.  
- Press "Run" (Enter) to process the image with LaMa.  
- Download the result with the "Download" button (S).  

## Keyboard Shortcuts  
- Ctrl+Z: Undo
- Ctrl+Y: Redo  
- H: Toggle Pan mode  
- B / P: Brush mode  
- E: Eraser mode  
- G: Bucket mode  
- [ ]: Decrease/Increase brush size  
- "+ / -": Zoom in/out  
- 0: Reset view  
- F: Load file  
- Enter: Run  
- S: Download
